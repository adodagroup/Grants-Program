## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Problem

Most existing online lottery platforms suffer from poor UI/UX and a lack of transparency. Many are run anonymously, raising serious trust and legitimacy concerns. Additionally, the traditional online lottery space has failed to embrace blockchain technology or serve the rapidly growing community of crypto users.

### 1.2 Solution: BitJackpot

BitJackpot is a Bitcoin-based online lottery platform targeting crypto users and lottery participants worldwide — a first-of-its-kind platform where users can buy lottery tickets using DOT (as the **primary payment method**) on the Polkadot network, along with other major chains like ETH, BNB, SOL, and TRX — and win prizes in Bitcoin.

The platform is designed with:

- Secure, verifiable blockchain infrastructure  
- Modern UI/UX  
- On-chain proof of fairness  
- Multichain ticket purchasing options (with DOT as default)  

Positioning DOT as the default and most prominent method of payment ensures strong integration with the Polkadot ecosystem, while support for other popular networks expands accessibility for crypto users globally.



### 1.3 Target Audience

- Worldwide.-based crypto users
- lottery buyers world wide
- DeFi and Web3 gaming enthusiasts

### 1.4 Value Proposition to Polkadot

- DOT will be adopted as a **primary payment method** for ticket purchases.
- Introduces real-world use case in **gaming** and **consumer applications**.
- Drives new users and transaction volume to the Polkadot ecosystem.
- Positions Polkadot as the **first blockchain** to support a Worldnwide crypto lottery experience.
